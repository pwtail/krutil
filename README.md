The vinyl project
---------------

It is an ongoing work to make django orm async. There is already v1 version of vinyl that proved
itself working and useful. v2 will take even more radical approach (the details will be later).

It will have both sync and async versions. As well as v1, it won't be a fork.

The sync version will be made to pass the django testsuite, so vinyl will be already beta-quality when released.
